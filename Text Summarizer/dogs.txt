How to Prepare Your Dog to Be Left at Home Alone (Again)


By Jen A. Miller


	Did you get a new dog during the coronavirus lockdown? Or has your long-time 
four-legged companion gotten used to having you home?

	â€œDogs are highly social, which is why we get along with them so well,â€ said Patricia 
B. McConnell, certified applied animal behaviorist and author of 
â€œThe Other End of the Leash: Why We Do What We Do Around Dogs.â€ â€œIf all the sudden, 
they go from â€˜everybody home all the timeâ€™ to â€˜nobody home all day long,â€™ it can lead to 
some serious behavioral problems.â€

	This can mean accidents in the house, chewing on the furniture when you are away, 
or worse.

	Want to avoid that? Hereâ€™s how to transition to a new normal, for both of you.

Start Leaving

	The members of your household probably havenâ€™t left the house for an extended period 
of time for what, weeks? Months? The 17 years this quarantine has felt like? So, start 
transitioning as cities and states reopen by leaving a little bit at a time. But not for 
too long. Start â€œunbelievably slow,â€ said Dr. McConnell. Leave a handful of treats on the 
ground and, while the dog is eating them, â€œeverybody walks out the door,â€ she said. Come 
back in five seconds. Next time, leave for 10 seconds, then walk to the mailbox and back, 
then take a longer walk or a long drive.

	Make sure you are mimicking the routine youâ€™ll have when you go back to work: Get your 
wallet and keys, leave through the door youâ€™ll go through. This way, the dog gets used 
to the cues that mean you are leaving â€” and coming back in through the same spot.



Give Your Dog a Safe Space

	Make sure your dog is left in a safe space that it knows â€” and donâ€™t lock it in a room 
thatâ€™s unfamiliar. That safe space might be a crate, though not all dogs like being in a 
crate. (My first dog, a Jack Russell terrier, loved her crate; the dog I have now, a 
cattle dog mix, couldnâ€™t be bothered.) Other dogs are just fine being left to lie 
wherever in the house they want.


	The best space for your dog may not be one with a view either, said Sarah Wilson, dog 
trainer and author of â€œMy Smart Puppy: Fun, Effective and Easy Puppy Training,â€ 
especially if your dog barks a lot. â€œWhen theyâ€™re screaming out the window at everyone 
whoâ€™s going by, their brains are flooded with all of this confusing and upsetting brain 
chemistry, which doesnâ€™t go away on its own instantly,â€ she said. â€œItâ€™s not a game for 
them when theyâ€™re barking hysterically out the window.â€ If a crate doesnâ€™t work for that 
dog, it may work to use a baby gate to keep it in a room it likes, but without access to 
a window.

Make a New Plan for Entertaining Your Dog

	If your dog has gotten used to walks every four or five hours, whatâ€™s going to happen 
when thatâ€™s not an easy option? Can you come home to walk the dog? Will you hire a dog 
walker, or take your dog to a doggie daycare?

	Dr. McConnell suggests you figure out how youâ€™re going to engage your dogsâ€™ brain if 
the level of physical exercise you are currently providing it is not an option. You can 
teach them new tricks, or try new walking routes, which engages their brains because dogs 
will work to analyze new smells.

	â€œEven if itâ€™s just once or twice a week, pop your dog in the car and go somewhere 
different,â€ said Dr. McConnell.

Look for Troubling Behavior â€” But Donâ€™t Punish

	Dogs with separation anxiety may go to the bathroom in the house, or chew or rip up 
things that are not their toys. But donâ€™t punish the dog when you come home, said 
Katherine A. Houpt, professor emeritus of behavior medicine at the Cornell University 
College of Veterinary Medicine, because dogs will forget what they did and by then they 
will â€œno longer associate punishment with the action.â€

	Your dog may also get clingy and follow you around the house, pace when it thinks 
youâ€™re leaving or drool. That also means the dog is experiencing separation anxiety and 
you need to work a little bit more to help it.

	If you are frustrated or feel like nothing is working, reach out for help. Call your 
veterinarian to make sure that nothing is physically wrong with your dog. If it is 
behavioral, then your veterinarian may recommend calling a dog trainer or animal 
behaviorist. Dr. McConnell said to look for a certified applied animal behaviorist or a 
certified professional dog trainer. Trainers should use positive reinforcement instead of 
force and coercion.

	Your veterinarian may also recommend anti-anxiety medication for your dog, if the 
anxiety persists despite making the recommended changes. You may also consider 
anti-anxiety medications if your dogâ€™s behavior is causing harm even if itâ€™s not 
destructive â€” such as if your dogâ€™s barking is annoying your neighbors to an 
extreme degree.
