History of Rock and Roll

	Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll, rock 'n' roll, or rock 'n roll) is a 
genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 
1940s and early 1950s[1][2] from musical styles such as gospel, jump blues, jazz, boogie 
woogie, rhythm and blues,[3] and country music.[4] While elements of what was to become 
rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s[5] and in country records of 
the 1930s,[4] the genre did not acquire its name until 1954.[6][7]

	According to journalist Greg Kot, "rock and roll" refers to a style of popular music 
originating in the U.S. in the 1950s prior to its development by the mid-1960s into 
"the more encompassing international style known as rock music, though the latter also 
continued to be known as rock and roll."[8] For the purpose of differentiation, this 
article deals with the first definition.

	In the earliest rock and roll styles, either the piano or saxophone was typically the 
lead instrument, but these instruments were generally replaced or supplemented by guitar 
in the middle to late 1950s.[9] The beat is essentially a dance rhythm[10] with an 
accentuated backbeat, which is almost always provided by a snare drum.[11] Classic rock 
and roll is usually played with one or two electric guitars (one lead, one rhythm), a 
double bass (string bass) or after the mid-1950s an electric bass guitar, and a drum kit.

	Beyond just a musical style, rock and roll, as depicted in movies, in fan magazines, 
and on television, influenced lifestyles, fashion, attitudes, and language. Rock and roll 
may have contributed to the civil rights movement because both African American and White 
American teenagers enjoyed the music.[12]


Terminology

	The term "rock and roll" is defined by EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica as the music that 
originated in the mid-1950s and later developed "into the more encompassing international 
style known as rock music".[8] The term is sometimes also used as synonymous with 
"rock music" and is defined as such in some dictionaries.[13][14]

   The phrase "rocking and rolling" originally described the movement of a ship on the 
ocean,[15] but by the early 20th century was used both to describe the spiritual fervor 
of black church rituals[16] and as a sexual analogy. Various gospel, blues and swing 
recordings used the phrase before it became used more frequently â€“ but still 
intermittently â€“ in the 1940s, on recordings and in reviews of what became known as 
"rhythm and blues" music aimed at a black audience.[16]

	In 1934, the song "Rock and Roll" by the Boswell Sisters appeared in the film 
Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round. In 1942, Billboard magazine columnist Maurie Orodenker 
started to use the term "rock-and-roll" to describe upbeat recordings such as "Rock Me" 
by Sister Rosetta Tharpe.[17] By 1943, the "Rock and Roll Inn" in South Merchantville, 
New Jersey, was established as a music venue.[18] In 1951, Cleveland, Ohio, disc jockey 
Alan Freed began playing this music style while popularizing the phrase to describe it.

Early Rock and Roll

Origins

	The origins of rock and roll have been fiercely debated by commentators and historians 
of music.[20] There is general agreement that it arose in the Southern United States â€“ 
a region that would produce most of the major early rock and roll acts â€“ through the 
meeting of various influences that embodied a merging of the African musical tradition 
with European instrumentation.[21] The migration of many former slaves and their 
descendants to major urban centers such as St. Louis, Memphis, New York City, Detroit, 
Chicago, Cleveland, and Buffalo (See: Second Great Migration (African American)) meant 
that black and white residents were living in close proximity in larger numbers than ever 
before, and as a result heard each other's music and even began to emulate each other's 
fashions.[22][23] Radio stations that made white and black forms of music available to 
both groups, the development and spread of the gramophone record, and African-American 
musical styles such as jazz and swing which were taken up by white musicians, aided this 
process of "cultural collision".

	The immediate roots of rock and roll lay in the rhythm and blues, then called 
"race music",[25] and country music of the 1940s and 1950s.[20] Particularly significant 
influences were jazz, blues, gospel, country, and folk. Commentators differ in their views 
of which of these forms were most important and the degree to which the new
music was a re-branding of African-American rhythm and blues for a white market, or a new 
hybrid of black and white forms.

In the 1930s, jazz, and particularly swing, both in urban- based dance bands and 
blues-influenced country swing (Jimmie Rodgers, Moon Mullican and other similar singers), 
were among the first music to present African- American sounds for a predominantly white 
audience. One particularly noteworthy example of a jazz song with recognizably rock and 
roll elements is Big Joe Turner with pianist Pete Johnson's 1939 single Roll 'Em Pete,
which is regarded as an important precursor of rock and roll. The 1940s saw the increased  
use of blaring horns (including saxophones), shouted lyrics and boogie woogie beats in 
jazz-based music. During and immediately after World War II, with shortages of fuel and 
limitations on audiences and available personnel, large jazz bands were less economical 
and tended to be replaced by smaller combos, using guitars, bass and drums.[20][33] In the 
same period, particularly on the West Coast and in the Midwest, the development of jump 
blues, with its guitar riffs, prominent beats and shouted lyrics, prefigured many later 
developments.[20] In the documentary film Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll, Keith Richards 
proposes that Chuck Berry developed his brand of rock and roll by transposing the familiar 
two-note lead line of jump blues piano directly to the electric guitar, creating what is 
instantly recognizable as rock guitar. Similarly, country boogie and Chicago electric 
blues supplied many of the elements that would be seen as characteristic of rock and 
roll. Inspired by electric blues, Chuck Berry introduced an aggressive guitar sound to 
rock and roll, and established the electric guitar as its centrepiece,[34] adapting his 
rock band instrumentation from the basic blues band instrumentation of a lead guitar, 
second chord instrument, bass and drums.

Rock and roll arrived at a time of considerable technological change, soon after the 
development of the electric guitar, amplifier and microphone, and the 45 rpm record.
There were also changes in the record industry, with the rise of independent labels like 
Atlantic, Sun and Chess servicing niche audiences and a similar rise of radio stations 
that played their music.[20] It was the realization that relatively affluent white 
teenagers were listening to this music that led to the development of what was to be 
defined as rock and roll as a distinct genre.[20] Because the development of rock and roll 
was an evolutionary process, no single record can be identified as unambiguously 
"the first" rock and roll record.[36] Contenders for the title of "first rock and roll
record" include Sister Rosetta Tharpe's "Strange Things Happening Every Day" (1944),[37], 
"That's All Right" by Arthur Crudup (1946), "The Fat Man" by Fats Domino (1949),[36] 
Goree Carter's "Rock Awhile" (1949),[38] Jimmy Preston's "Rock the Joint" (1949), which 
was later covered by Bill Haley & His Comets in 1952,[39] "Rocket 88" by Jackie Brenston 
and his Delta Cats (Ike Turner and his band The Kings of Rhythm), recorded by Sam Phillips 
for Sun Records in March 1951.[40] In terms of its wide cultural impact across society in 
the US and elsewhere, Bill Haley's "Rock Around the Clock",[41] recorded in April 1954 but 
not a commercial success until the following year, is generally recognized as an important 
milestone, but it was preceded by many recordings from earlier decades in which elements 
of rock and roll can be clearly discerned.

Other artists with early rock and roll hits included Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, 
Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Gene Vincent.[40] Chuck Berry's 1955 classic 
"Maybellene" in particular features a distorted electric guitar solo with warm overtones 
created by his small valve amplifier.[44] However, the use of distortion was predated by 
electric blues guitarists such as Joe Hill Louis,[45] Guitar Slim,[46] Willie Johnson of 
Howlin' Wolf's band,[47] and Pat Hare; the latter two also made use of distorted power 
chords in the early 1950s.[48] Also in 1955, Bo Diddley introduced the "Bo Diddley beat" 
and a unique electric guitar style,[49] influenced by African and Afro-Cuban music and 
in turn influencing many later artists.
