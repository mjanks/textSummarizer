[40] In terms of its wide cultural impact across society in the US and elsewhere, Bill Haley's "Rock Around the Clock",[41] recorded in April 1954 but not a commercial success until the following year, is generally recognized as an important milestone, but it was preceded by many recordings from earlier decades in which elements of rock and roll can be clearly discerned. 
 Beyond just a musical style, rock and roll, as depicted in movies, in fan magazines, and on television, influenced lifestyles, fashion, attitudes, and language.

 Various gospel, blues and swing recordings used the phrase before it became used more frequently â€“ but still intermittently â€“ in the 1940s, on recordings and in reviews of what became known as "rhythm and blues" music aimed at a black audience. 
 Commentators differ in their views of which of these forms were most important and the degree to which the new music was a re-branding of African-American rhythm and blues for a white market, or a new hybrid of black and white forms.
