This program takes .txt file and an integer n as input and returns a summary of the .txt file that includes n number of sentences. The input is entered in main, the user is not prompted. The .txt file is parsed using the split method and the resulting tokens are stripped of their stop words using an algorithm that compares each word in the token to a known list of English stop words. The list I've included can be found here: http://xpo6.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/stop-word-list.txt For each sentence I calculated the NTF. I also calculated a global IDF. I then multiplied these two together for each word  of each sentence and took the sum of those products to produce a ranking for each sentence. A lot of pre-processing was done to make sure the sentences and word lists being generated were filled with the correct content. I stored all of the ranked sentences in a TreeMap data structure. Then based on the number of sentences ‘n’ the user would like to see in the summary, I returned the ‘n’ highest ranked sentences in descending order.
