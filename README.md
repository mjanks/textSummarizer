This program takes .txt file and an integer n as input and returns a summary of the .txt file that includes n number of sentences. The input is entered in main, the user is not prompted. The .txt file is parsed using the split method and the resulting tokens are stripped of their stop words using an algorithm that compares each word in the token to a known list of English stop words. The list I've included can be found here: http://xpo6.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/stop-word-list.txt Also implemented is a TFIDF calculator, IDF calculation is not working correctly.
